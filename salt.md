title: The dangers of Sodium Chloride
---
***Main Claim.*** Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is a molecule made from combining Sodium Ions and Chloride Ions into a single crystal. Sodium is a HIGHLY dangerous material that reacts violently to water. Chlorine (also known as Chloride) is also a HIGHLY reactive and dangerous gas. Being that NaCl is made from combining these two materials, it is clear how NaCl is an incredibly dangerous material.

***More on Sodium.*** Sodium metal (Na) is a metal that binds tightly to the nuerons inside your body, changing how those nuerons perform there job. It also makes the water in your body conducive, causing your whole body to short circuit and die. Plants can also have small amounts of sodium in them, although not enough to kill a human.

***More on Chloride.*** Chloride gas (Cl) is a gas that kills anyone who breathes it in. It also changes the conductivity of the inside of your body, short circuiting it just like sodium. Chloride is between Fluorine (the thing used to incapassate someone) and Bromine (a gassues mattieral that is completely deadly to breath in), making it have the properties of both, making it extra deadly.

***Conclusion.*** So in totally we have a highly toxic gas that will kill you at any chance it gets, and a metal that when ingested will wreak havoc on your body. From this info it is clear as day how NaCl is exclusively a deadly matterial that will kill you at any chance it gets.
